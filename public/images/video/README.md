# Video Backgrounds

Drop video files into this directory. Used by the VideoBackground component with static image fallbacks.

## Guidelines:
- Formats: MP4, WebM recommended
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web delivery
- Provide static .webp fallback images with same name
- Example: `hero-video.mp4` + `hero-video.webp` fallback
