# Background Assets

Drop background images into this directory. These are used as subtle textures behind major sections.

## Supported Formats

You can upload files in **any** of these formats — the site auto-detects:
- `.webp` (recommended — smallest file size)
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg` (most common, works great)
- `.png` (larger files but fully supported)

Just drop the file with the right **name** (see below) in any format and it will load automatically.

## Required Files:
- `section-bg-1` → Homepage engines section
- `section-bg-2` → CAPS network section
- `section-bg-3` → About section
- `section-bg-4` → Trust section
- `section-bg-5` → Pricing section

Examples of valid filenames:
- `section-bg-1.webp`
- `section-bg-1.jpg`
- `section-bg-1.jpeg`

## Guidelines:
- Recommended size: 1920x1080 or higher
- Keep file size under 2MB for best performance
- Images are used as background textures so subtle/dark images work best
- WebP format is preferred for smallest file size if you have the option
