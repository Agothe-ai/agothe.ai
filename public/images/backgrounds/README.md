# Background Assets

Drop background images (.webp format) into this directory. These are used as subtle textures behind major sections.

## Required Files:
- `section-bg-1.webp` → Homepage engines section
- `section-bg-2.webp` → CAPS network section
- `section-bg-3.webp` → About section
- `section-bg-4.webp` → Trust section
- `section-bg-5.webp` → Pricing section

## Guidelines:
- Format: WebP
- Used at 15-35% opacity via CSS `background-image`
- Subtle, low-contrast textures work best
- Will be layered behind content with dark void background (#0a0a0a)
