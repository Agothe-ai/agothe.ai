# Section Images

Drop in-page section images (.webp format) into this directory. These are used within page content, below the fold.

## Guidelines:
- Format: WebP
- Lazy loaded (no priority prop)
- Used by SmartImage component with fallback support
- Should complement the dark theme with teal/gold accents
