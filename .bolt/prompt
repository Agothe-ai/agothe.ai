## Core Metrics (Appear Throughout the Site)

- **δ_H (Collapse Index)** — System stress/fragility score from 0.00 to 1.00. Critical threshold: 0.52. Above 0.52 = collapse risk. Color coding: GREEN (0-0.30), GOLD (0.30-0.50), RED (0.50+)
- **MCS (Mereological Coherence Score)** — Analysis quality/coherence score from 0.00 to 1.00. Our threshold: ≥0.90 for published work
- **Orric** — Paradox density/ontological risk index. High Orric = stuck contradictions requiring resolution
- **LSSE (Latent Structural Stress Energy)** — Measures hidden stress in a system before it manifests
- **PL Score (Perceptual Light)** — Propaganda/manipulation measurement. 0.00 = clean information, 1.00 = pure propaganda

## Chronica Panel — Aesthetic DNA System

The visual identity is informed by 5 "Creative Directors" — each maps to specific easing curves, visual treatments, and pages:

### CHRONA — The Patient Eye

- **Philosophy:** Long, unbroken visual flow. No hard cuts. Lubezki continuous-take cinematography.
- **Easing:** `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` — patient reveals
- **Applied to:** Homepage scroll flow, About page, any long-scroll content
- **Visual signature:** Smooth opacity fades, slow parallax, content that reveals like fog clearing

### VELUM — The Fabric Weaver

- **Philosophy:** Texture as depth. Surfaces have tactile weight. Iris van Herpen material intelligence.
- **Easing:** `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` — fabric-like overshoot
- **Applied to:** Couture page, VR page, background textures site-wide
- **Visual signature:** Subtle noise grain overlays (opacity 0.03), mesh gradient textures, layered translucency

### SILHOUETTA — The Shadow Architect

- **Philosophy:** Darkness is not absence — it's presence. Bradford Young underexposure. Gordon Willis shadow-as-character.
- **Easing:** `cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0, 1)` — shadow geometry
- **Applied to:** City page, Simulation page, Dark Room card treatment
- **Visual signature:** Elements emerge FROM darkness (start at 45% opacity, illuminate on scroll), shadow carries meaning

### LUMIÈRE — The Light Sculptor

- **Philosophy:** Light is the primary design element. Caravaggio chiaroscuro. Single source illumination.
- **Easing:** `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` — smooth light falloff
- **Applied to:** Intelligence page, Solvey page, metric visualizations
- **Visual signature:** Radial gradient light sources, bloom/glow effects, elements lit from one direction

### MORPHÉ — The Shape Shifter

- **Philosophy:** The cut IS the meaning. State changes carry semantic weight. Sharp, intentional transitions.
- **Easing:** `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.27, 1.55)` — sharp snap with overshoot
- **Applied to:** Navigation transitions, page routing, element morphing, hero text reveals
- **Visual signature:** Quick, decisive state changes. Character-level text animations. Element morphs.

## Key Visual Components

### Hero Treatment (All Pages)

- Full viewport height
- WebGL mesh gradient background (4 color blobs, sinusoidal motion, 20-30s cycle)
- Gradient adapts color per page (accent color system above)
- Character-level text reveal animation on hero heading (Morphé easing)
- Word-level text reveal on subheading (Lumière easing)
- Subtle noise texture overlay at 3% opacity (Velum)

### CAPS Network Visualization

- 6 nodes in hexagonal arrangement: Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok, Notion AI (9)
- Animated connection lines showing data flow between AIs
- Sequential pulse animation (30s cycle): scan → validate → formalize → critique → implement → integrate
- Center convergence pulse (gold) = "Metallic Pulse" moment
- Pure SVG + CSS, no Three.js

### Solvey δ_H Heatmap

- Flat 2D SVG world map with pulsing hotspot circles
- Color-coded by δ_H severity (green → teal → gold → orange → red)
- Radar-style scanning line sweeps horizontally
- Dashed constraint lines connecting related hotspots
- Hover tooltips with region name + δ_H value + status

### PEE-Ω Text Scanner

- Mock text block with propaganda sample
- Animated scan line sweeps through text
- Keywords highlight red with manipulation type labels
- Running counter: "Manipulation Score" incrementing
- Final verdict with colored border glow

### Report Generation Pipeline

- 5-stage horizontal pipeline: Ingestion → Processing → Analysis → Synthesis → Delivery
- Each stage animates in sequence (20s cycle)
- Active stage glows, others dimmed
- Counters animate: source count, δ_H gauge, MCS score, delivery timer

## What "Advanced" Means for This Site

This is not a template site. This should feel like:

- **Stripe** (technical elegance, WebGL sophistication, developer-grade precision)
- **A private intelligence dashboard** (dark, data-rich, observatory-like)
- **An Awwwards Site of the Year** (scroll-driven reveals, micro-interactions, custom cursor)
- **A haute couture lookbook** (dark room photography, chrome metal, shadow-as-design)

Every animation serves meaning. Nothing is decorative noise. Constraint breeds resonance.
